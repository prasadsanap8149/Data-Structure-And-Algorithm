## 📊 Capacity Planning Formulas

### **Storage Estimation**

```
📦 Total Storage = Users × Data_per_User × (1 + Replication_Factor)

Example: 100M users × 1KB user_data × 3 replicas = 300GB

🗄️ Database Size Calculation
- Consider data growth rate
- Account for indexes (20-30% overhead)
- Include backup storage requirements
- Plan for data archiving
```

### **Bandwidth Estimation**

```
🌐 Peak QPS = Daily_Active_Users × Actions_per_User / 86400 × Peak_Factor

Example: 10M DAU × 100 actions × 3 peak_factor / 86400 = 34,722 QPS

📡 Bandwidth = Average_Request_Size × QPS + Average_Response_Size × QPS

Example: (1KB + 10KB) × 35K QPS = 385 MB/s
```

### **Server Estimation**

```
🖥️ Application Servers = Peak_QPS / Server_Capacity

Example: 35K QPS / 1K QPS per server = 35 servers

💾 Database Servers = Data_Size / Server_Storage + Read_QPS / Read_Capacity

Example: 1TB / 500GB + 30K / 10K = 2 + 3 = 5 servers
```
