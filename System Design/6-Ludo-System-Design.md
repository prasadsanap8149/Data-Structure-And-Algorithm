# Ludo Game System Design

## 1. System Architecture & Overview

### 1.1 High-Level Architecture

```
[Client Apps] → [API Gateway] → [Game Engine] → [Matchmaking] → [Databases]
     ↓              ↓              ↓              ↓              ↓
[Mobile/Web] → [Load Balancer] → [State Management] → [Player Matching] → [MongoDB/Redis]
```

### 1.2 Working Logic Flow
