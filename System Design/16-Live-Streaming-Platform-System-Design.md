# Live Streaming Platform System Design (Twitch/YouTube Live)

## 1. System Architecture & Overview

### 1.1 High-Level Architecture

```
[Streamers] → [Ingest Servers] → [Transcoding] → [CDN] → [Viewers]
     ↓              ↓              ↓             ↓        ↓
[OBS/Mobile] → [RTMP Gateway] → [Media Processing] → [Edge Servers] → [Web/Mobile Apps]
```

### 1.2 Working Logic Flow

1. **Stream Ingestion**: Streamer setup → RTMP/WebRTC upload → Quality validation → Stream routing
2. **Media Processing**: Transcoding → Multiple qualities → Format conversion → Packaging
3. **Content Distribution**: CDN delivery → Edge caching → Geographic optimization → Viewer delivery
4. **Real-time Interaction**: Chat system → Donations → Moderation → Community features
5. **Monetization**: Advertisements → Subscriptions → Creator revenue → Analytics tracking
