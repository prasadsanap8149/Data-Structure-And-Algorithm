# Cloud Storage System Design (Google Drive/Dropbox)

## 1. System Architecture & Overview

### 1.1 High-Level Architecture

```
[Client Apps] → [API Gateway] → [File Services] → [Storage Layer] → [Databases]
     ↓              ↓              ↓               ↓                ↓
[Web/Mobile/Desktop] → [Load Balancer] → [Upload/Download] → [Distributed Storage] → [Metadata DB]
```

### 1.2 Working Logic Flow

1. **File Upload**: Chunking → Deduplication → Encryption → Storage → Metadata update
2. **File Download**: Authentication → Metadata lookup → Chunk assembly → Decryption → Delivery
3. **Synchronization**: Change detection → Conflict resolution → Delta sync → Version management
4. **Sharing**: Permission management → Link generation → Access control → Notification
5. **Collaboration**: Real-time editing → Operational transformation → Conflict resolution → Version control

## 2. Core Components & Descriptions

### 2.1 File Storage Infrastructure (Why this tier exists)

**Purpose**: Provides scalable, reliable, and efficient file storage with global accessibility

- **Distributed Storage**: Horizontal scaling across multiple data centers
- **Deduplication**: Reduces storage costs by eliminating duplicate content
- **Version Control**: Maintains file history and enables rollback capabilities
- **Synchronization Engine**: Keeps files consistent across all user devices

### 2.2 Data Storage Architecture & Database Explanations

#### Primary Databases:

- **PostgreSQL (Relational)**

  - **Purpose**: User accounts, file metadata, sharing permissions, version history
  - **Why chosen**: ACID compliance for critical metadata, complex queries for permissions
  - **Tables**:
    ```sql
    users: user_id, email, storage_quota, subscription_plan, created_at, last_login
    files: file_id, user_id, filename, file_path, size, content_hash, created_at, modified_at
    file_versions: version_id, file_id, version_number, size, content_hash, created_at, is_current
    permissions: permission_id, file_id, user_id, permission_type, granted_by, created_at
    shared_links: link_id, file_id, access_token, expiry_date, access_count, created_by
    ```

- **MongoDB (NoSQL)**

  - **Purpose**: File chunks metadata, folder structures, flexible file attributes
  - **Why chosen**: Flexible schema for varying file metadata, efficient for hierarchical data
  - **Collections**:
    ```javascript
    file_chunks: {
      chunk_id, file_id, chunk_index, storage_location, checksum, size;
    }
    folder_structure: {
      folder_id, parent_id, name, path, owner_id, permissions, created_at;
    }
    file_metadata: {
      file_id, mime_type, thumbnail_path, preview_data, custom_attributes;
    }
    sync_events: {
      event_id,
        user_id,
        device_id,
        file_id,
        action_type,
        timestamp,
        sync_status;
    }
    ```

- **Redis (In-Memory)**

  - **Purpose**: Active sessions, upload progress, cache, real-time collaboration
  - **Why chosen**: Ultra-low latency for real-time features, session management
  - **Use cases**: Upload progress tracking, active file locks, collaborative editing state, cache

- **Cassandra (Wide-Column)**

  - **Purpose**: Activity logs, audit trails, time-series data
  - **Why chosen**: Excellent for write-heavy workloads, time-series data storage
  - **Tables**:
    ```sql
    activity_logs: log_id, user_id, file_id, action_type, timestamp, device_info, ip_address
    audit_trail: audit_id, user_id, action, resource_id, timestamp, details, compliance_flag
    ```

- **Distributed File System (HDFS/GlusterFS)**

  - **Purpose**: Actual file content storage with replication and distribution
  - **Why chosen**: Horizontal scalability, data redundancy, cost-effective for large files
  - **Structure**: Sharded by content hash, replicated across data centers

- **Object Storage (S3/GCS)**
  - **Purpose**: Cold storage, backups, large file archives
  - **Why chosen**: Cost-effective for infrequently accessed data, high durability
  - **Tiers**: Hot (frequent access), Cool (monthly access), Cold (annual access)

### 2.3 Technical Stack & Component Justification
