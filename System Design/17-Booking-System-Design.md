# Booking System Design (Airbnb/Hotel Booking)

## 1. System Architecture & Overview

### 1.1 High-Level Architecture

```
[Client Apps] → [API Gateway] → [Booking Services] → [Inventory Management] → [Databases]
     ↓              ↓              ↓                    ↓                      ↓
[Web/Mobile] → [Load Balancer] → [Search/Reservation] → [Availability Engine] → [PostgreSQL/Redis]
```

### 1.2 Working Logic Flow

1. **Property Listing**: Host registration → Property details → Photos/amenities → Pricing setup → Listing approval
2. **Search & Discovery**: Location input → Date selection → Filter application → Property ranking → Result display
3. **Booking Process**: Property selection → Date confirmation → Guest details → Payment processing → Reservation confirmation
4. **Stay Management**: Check-in coordination → Communication → Issue resolution → Experience tracking
5. **Post-Stay**: Check-out → Review exchange → Payment settlement → Analytics logging

## 2. Core Components & Descriptions

### 2.1 Booking Management Infrastructure (Why this tier exists)

**Purpose**: Orchestrates complex property reservations with real-time availability and pricing

- **Inventory Management**: Real-time availability tracking across millions of properties
- **Search & Discovery**: Advanced search with filters, maps, and personalized recommendations
- **Reservation Engine**: Handles booking conflicts, pricing, and confirmation workflows
- **Payment Processing**: Secure payment handling with multiple currencies and methods

### 2.2 Data Storage Architecture & Database Explanations

#### Primary Databases:

- **PostgreSQL (Relational)**

  - **Purpose**: User accounts, property data, bookings, payments, structured business data
  - **Why chosen**: ACID compliance for financial transactions, complex queries for search and analytics
  - **Tables**:
    ```sql
    users: user_id, email, phone, profile_info, verification_status, registration_date
    properties: property_id, host_id, title, description, address, coordinates, property_type
    amenities: amenity_id, property_id, amenity_type, description, verified
    bookings: booking_id, property_id, guest_id, check_in, check_out, guests, total_price, status
    payments: payment_id, booking_id, amount, currency, payment_method, status, transaction_id
    reviews: review_id, booking_id, reviewer_id, rating, comment, response, created_at
    ```

- **MongoDB (NoSQL)**

  - **Purpose**: Property details, search metadata, flexible content, user preferences
  - **Why chosen**: Flexible schema for varying property data, geospatial queries, fast reads
  - **Collections**:
    ```javascript
    property_details: {
      property_id, photos, detailed_amenities, house_rules, pricing_rules;
    }
    search_metadata: {
      property_id, search_tags, category, instant_book, superhost_status;
    }
    user_preferences: {
      user_id, search_history, favorite_locations, booking_preferences;
    }
    host_calendar: {
      property_id,
        date,
        availability_status,
        price,
        minimum_stay,
        blocked_dates;
    }
    ```

- **Redis (In-Memory)**

  - **Tables**:
    ```sql
    user_activities: user_id, timestamp, activity_type, property_id, session_id, device_info
    booking_events: booking_id, timestamp, event_type, status_change, user_id, details
    pricing_history: property_id, date, price, occupancy_rate, demand_factor, season_type
    ```

- **Object Storage (S3/GCS)**
  - **Purpose**: Property photos, documents, verification files, backup data
  - **Why chosen**: Cost-effective for large media files, high availability, CDN integration
