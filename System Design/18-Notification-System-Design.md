# Notification System Design

## 1. System Architecture & Overview

### 1.1 High-Level Architecture

```
[Services] → [Notification Gateway] → [Channel Routers] → [Delivery Providers] → [End Users]
     ↓              ↓                    ↓                   ↓                   ↓
[App Events] → [Message Queue] → [Push/Email/SMS] → [Provider APIs] → [Mobile/Email/Phone]
```

### 1.2 Working Logic Flow

1. **Event Triggering**: Application events → Event processing → Notification rules → Message generation
2. **Channel Selection**: User preferences → Delivery priorities → Channel routing → Provider selection
3. **Message Processing**: Template processing → Personalization → Content optimization → Delivery preparation
4. **Delivery Execution**: Provider routing → Delivery attempt → Status tracking → Retry handling
5. **Analytics & Feedback**: Delivery confirmation → Engagement tracking → Performance analysis → Optimization

## 2. Core Components & Descriptions

### 2.1 Notification Infrastructure (Why this tier exists)

**Purpose**: Orchestrates multi-channel message delivery with reliability and personalization

- **Event Processing Engine**: Captures and processes application events for notification triggers
